在前面的课程中我们习惯使用 `def` 来定义函数，但在与高阶函数（如 `map()`、`filter()`）配合使用时，匿名内联函数（lambda）非常方便。

例如，把一个简单的平方函数写成 lambda：

```py
lambda num: num ** 2
```

lambda 是匿名函数，适合用于需要短小函数的场景，例如：

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # [2, 4]
```

注意：将 lambda 赋值给变量（从而失去匿名性）通常违背其初衷，这种情况下建议直接定义常规函数：

```py
def square(num):
    return num ** 2

squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))
```

也要避免把复杂逻辑塞到单行 lambda 中，这样会降低可读性。lambda 与常规函数各有适用场景：当需要简短的一行表达式时可用 lambda，否则使用 `def` 更清晰明了。
